# Poker Game

The world's simplest poker.

## Requirements

This game can be played with 2 or more players.
Immediately after the cards are dealt, the player with the highest hand wins!

## Program should output like this

## Technologies

- Ruby v2.4.0
- RSpec v3.6.0 (Testing framework)

## Approach

- **Planning:** Focusing on agile and Object Orientated Design, I broke down the specification into smaller issues to write [user stories](#User Stories). Domain modelling enabled me to identify 'noun' and 'verb' relationships. Diagramming aided in visualising my thought process.

- **Test Driven Development:**
